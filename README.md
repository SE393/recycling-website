# Welcome in -- now who's ready to RECYCLE??

## Our mission
When traveling it is often hard to keep up with what materials can be recycled in each
city you go to. Every location has different regulations on what can be recycled and that
information can sometimes be difficult to find. To make it easier, we want to create a
website that will give you information on recycling in each city/state in the US. Users
will be able to type in where they are and then get specific information on recycling and
how the process of recycling works for that location. 

## Definition of "done"
* Creating a working website
* We are able to pull data directly from state websites
* Having at least 5 states fully functional on our website
* Are able to have 3 different people utilize the website with no guidance to look up the
recycling guidelines of a certain county
